  <h2>Good Kid /M.A.A.D City A Hooked? review </h2>
  <hr noshade size=2>
  <p>
    Kendrick Lamar is no stranger to critical and general public acclaim,<br>
    due to his willing explore into new sounds despite us fans being hesitant,<br>
    so Mr Lamar's not just a great rapper <br>
    he is also a great composer and curator of sounds.

  <p>
    I listened to the project as a whole in early 2020 a good 8 years after its release <br>
    it truly upset me that I never thought to listen earlier but after thinking about it ,it came to me,<br>
    no way a 12 year old would have related and understood lamar. <br>
  </p>

  <p>
    GK/MC has been manicured and picked at by Mr lamar ,like a chef with twezers perfecting <br>
    a three stared michellin dish ,for their customers.<br>
  <p>
    Small details grace this album ,like the static sounds of a TV during the conversations laced throughout this project.<br>
    The album starts off with a tape being inserted into a player,<br>
    the person watching is us ,the listener looking back at his teenage years ,analysing his actions and the environment he grew up in, <br>
    I believe the reason we never hear Lamar speak with his friends in these conversations <br>
    is because he is speaking through his raps ,it could aslo reflect that he rarely talked unless he was rapping <br>
  </p>

  <p>
    this makes one appreciate and gush on the attention to detail Mr Lamar puts into this project. <br>
    I know they are plenty more easter eggs just waiting to be found which keeps me coming to listen to GK/MC <br>
    listening is key in the album ,listening because I know not to take anything any sounds for granted in this Project <br>
    everything feels purposeful and resulting in a multiple layered opus.
